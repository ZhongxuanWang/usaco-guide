<FocusProblem problem="sam" />

You should already have done this problem in
[Point Update Range Sum](/gold/PURS), but here we'll present two more
approaches. Both run in $\mathcal{O}((N+Q)\sqrt N)$ time.

## Blocking

<!-- partitioning into sqrt blocks (each block can have some sort of data structure ...)
 -->

See the first example in CPH.

```cpp
int n,q;
vi x;
ll block[450];
int BLOCK;

ll sum(int a) { // sum of first a elements of array in O(sqrt(n)) time
	ll ans = 0;
	F0R(i,a/BLOCK) ans += block[i];
	FOR(i,a/BLOCK*BLOCK,a) ans += x[i];
	return ans;
}

void upd(int a, int b) { // O(1) query
	block[a/BLOCK] -= x[a];
	x[a] = b;
	block[a/BLOCK] += x[a];
}

int main() {
	setIO(); re(n,q); x.rsz(n); re(x);
	BLOCK = sqrt(n);
	F0R(i,n) block[i/BLOCK] += x[i];
	F0R(i,q) {
		int t,a,b; re(t,a,b);
		if (t == 1) upd(a-1,b);
		else ps(sum(b)-sum(a-1));
	}
}
```

## Batching

See the CPH section on "batch processing."

Maintain a "buffer" of the latest updates (up to $\sqrt N$). The answer for each
sum query can be calculated with prefix sums and by examining each update within
the buffer. When the buffer gets too large ($\ge \sqrt N$), clear it and
recalculate prefix sums.

```cpp
int n,q;
vi x;
vl cum;

void build() {
	cum = {0};
	trav(t,x) cum.pb(cum.bk+t);
}

int main() {
	setIO(); re(n,q);
	x.rsz(n); re(x);
	build();
	vpi upd;
	F0R(i,q) {
		int t,a,b; re(t,a,b);
		if (t == 1) {
			a --;
			upd.pb({a,b-x[a]}); x[a] = b;
		} else {
			ll ans = cum[b]-cum[a-1]; a --, b--;
			trav(u,upd) if (a <= u.f && u.f <= b) ans += u.s;
			ps(ans);
		}
		if (sz(upd)*sz(upd) >= n) upd.clear(), build();
	}
}
```

## Additional Notes

Low constraints (ex. $n=5\cdot 10^4$) and/or high time limits (greater than 2s)
can be signs that sqrt decomp is intended.

[CPH 262](/CPH.pdf#page=262):

> In practice, it is not necessary to use the exact value of $\sqrt n$ as a
> parameter, and instead we may use parameters $k$ and $n/k$ where $k$ is
> different from $\sqrt n$. The optimal parameter depends on the problem and
> input. For example, if an algorithm often goes through the blocks but rarely
> inspects single elements inside the blocks, it may be a good idea to divide
> the array into $k<\sqrt n$ blocks, each of which contains $n/k > \sqrt n$
> elements.

As another example, if an update takes time proportional to the size of one
block ($\mathcal{O}(n/k)$) while a query takes time proportional to the number
of blocks times $\log n$ ($\mathcal{O}(k\log n)$) then we can set
$k\approx \sqrt{\frac{n}{\log n}}$ to make both updates and queries take time
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n\log n})$.

Solutions with worse complexities are not necessarily slower (at least for
problems with reasonable input sizes, ex. $n\le 5\cdot 10^5$). I recall an
instance where a fast $\mathcal{O}(n\sqrt n\log n)$ solution passed (where
$\log n$ came from a BIT) while an $\mathcal{O}(n\sqrt n)$ solution did not ...
So constant factors are important!

## On Trees

The techniques mentioned in the blogs below are extremely rare but worth a
mention.

## Problems

### A

Problems where the best solution I know of involves sqrt decomp.

<Problems problems="fst" />

### B

Problems that can be solved without it. But you might as well try to use it!!
