The most popular languages that USACO supports are
[C++11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B),
[Java](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)>), and
[Python 3](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>).
Pascal used to be popular in the past, but its use is rare now, and many
programming contests have removed or are planning to remove support for it in
the near future (in short: don't use it now). C is also supported, but it's
essentially a strictly inferior version of C++ and doesn't have the built-in
data structures that are often used. In general, we recommend the following:

- **If you already know one of these languages, just use it.**
  - If you know multiple languages, we recommend you pick C++ over Java, and
    Java over Python.
- **For Bronze, any language will do.** It is possible to receive full credit
  with C++, Java, and Python in Bronze.
- **For Silver<Asterisk>However, if Python is the only language you know / you
  really want to use Python, you can still pass Silver with Python.</Asterisk>,
  Gold, and Platinum, Python is not recommended**, because it is a slow language
  and lacks an ordered map.
- Check
  [Factors to Consider When Choosing a Language](/general/factors-choosing) for
  more information.

Keep in mind that it's easy to switch languages down the road. Don't get caught
up on which language to choose. Just pick the one you feel most comfortable
with!

## Expected Knowledge

We assume that you know how to code in one of the languages listed above. For a
more detailed list on what you should know, read the
[Expected Knowledge module](/general/expected).
