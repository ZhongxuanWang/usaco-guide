Note that the USACO Guide has a public
[Github Repository](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide). Feel free to
contribute by submitting issues and Pull Requests!

**Please help fix some of the
[issues](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/issues) on our Github
Repository!**

## Ways to Contribute

Some examples:

### Lesson

- Convert lists of resources to tables (Plat / Advanced).
- Add missing descriptions for sections, modules, or resources.
  - All resources should have descriptions.
- Improve explanations for sample problems.
  - If starred resource or editorial already has a good explanation, no need to
    repeat it.
- Improve implementations.
  - Include code handling input & output.
  - Should be consistent across languages.
- Adding modules!

### Problems

- Convert lists of problems to tables (Plat / Advanced).
- Fix problem difficulties and tags.
- Add problems that are good examples of the module topic (and remove those that
  are not).
- Adding official editorial links.
  - Those for USACO are automatically generated.
- Adding editorials.
  - If no editorial exists, or if existing editorial could be improved.
  - Or solution code in a different language, etc.

<!-- - Don't link CF if it's already included in "Contest Materials." -->

## Writing Content

All modules are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (Markdown + JSX), with
limited $\LaTeX$ support from [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) and some custom
components. You can check how an `.mdx` file renders by pasting it in the
[live editor](/editor).

See the
[Content Documentation](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/docs/Content%20Documentation.md)
for more info.

- [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/)
  - nice markdown editor
  - supports Katex
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  - `.md` syntax highlighting is fine, is also ok for `.mdx`
  - You can open a `.mdx` file and set syntax highlighting to be the same as
    `.md` with
    `View -> Syntax -> Open all with current extension as ... -> Markdown -> Markdown`.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
  - Markdown editor
  - Automatically compiles $\LaTeX$ (doesn't require an installation)

### Adding a Solution

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)
   the GitHub repository.

2. If it doesn't already exist, create a new `mdx` file in `solutions` including
   frontmatter, ex. the following in
   [`USACO jan17-cow-dance-show.mdx`](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/solutions/USACO%20jan17-cow-dance-show.mdx):

   ```

   [Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_cowdance_silver_jan17.html)

   ## Explanation

   (add explanation here ...)

   Use `\texttt{}` around variable names with length *greater than one*, like so. Place long equations on separate lines with display math, and use `\cdot` instead of `*` to denote multiplication.

   $$
   \texttt{arr}[i]=2\cdot (a+b+c+d+e)+\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}\texttt{arr}[j]
   $$

   Some additional text styles which you might consider using:

   http://latexref.xyz/Font-styles.html

   http://applied-r.com/latex-font-styles/

   $func(var)$

   $\textit{func(var)}$

   $\textrm{func(var)}$

   $\text{func(var)}$

   $\textsf{func(var)}$

   $\textbf{func(var)}$

   $\texttt{func(var)}$

   ## Implementation

   **Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log^2N)$

   ^ Format time complexity like this. Should appear outside of `<LanguageSection>` if it's the same for all implementations.

   <LanguageSection>

   <CPPSection>

   (add cpp code)

   </CPPSection>

   <PySection>

   (if you have Python code)

   </PySection>

   <JavaSection />

   <!-- if you have no Java code -->

   </LanguageSection>
   ```

   Keep file names and solution IDs consistent; namely, USACO IDs should
   correspond to the URL on
   [usaco.org](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=690).

3. Add your implementation, following the conventions below. It is **not**
   necessary to add an alternative implementation in the same language as the
   official analysis (unless the alternative implementation takes a different
   approach or is written better / differently from the official
   implementation).

4. Add the solution ID (ex. `usaco-690`) as the last argument of the `Problem`
   constructor in the corresponding module (in this case,
   [`Binary_Search_Ans.mdx`](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/blob/master/content/3_Silver/Binary_Search_Ans.mdx)).
   Also add tags (if you want).

```
new Problem(
  'Silver',
  'Cow Dance Show',
  '690',
  'Easy',
  false,
  ['tag1', 'tag2'],
  'usaco-690'
),
```

5. Check that both the module and the solution render properly using the
   [live editor](/editor/) before submitting a
   [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

### Code Conventions

Since code for the USACO Guide is contributed from several authors, code style
will **not** be uniform. Of course, we still strive for code that is readable
and understandable. If any code does not compile or is hard to read, please
contact us.

Please read the following resource before contributing code (although you do not
have to follow all of the recommendations):

<!--
<Resource
	source="MIT"
	title="Course Notes: Style"
	url="https://py.mit.edu/fall20/notes/style"
	starred
>
	Python-specific (but still generally useful)
</Resource>
-->

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="CF"
		title="Swift - Competitive C++ Manifesto"
		url="64218"
		starred
	>
		C++ style guide
	</Resource>
</Resources>

<IncompleteSection>

additional resources about style?

</IncompleteSection>

Additional Notes:

- Use _tabs_ to indent.
- Lines should not exceed 80 characters.
- Be _consistent_ about formatting your code, unlike the following snippet:

  <br />

  ```py
  a,b = (0,1)
  print(a+b)
  print(a + b)
  ```

  We don't care about which one you use (`a+b` or `a + b`), but pick one and
  stick with it!

#### C++ Template

For Bronze through Gold, please only use the macros listed in the template below
(see [Github #806](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/issues/806)):

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> // see /general/running-code-locally
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

using vi = vector<int>;
#define pb push_back
#define all(x) begin(x), end(x)
#define sz(x) (int)(x).size()

using pi = pair<int,int>;
#define f first
#define s second
#define mp make_pair

void setIO(string name = "") {
	cin.tie(0)->sync_with_stdio(0); // see /general/fast-io
	if (sz(name)) {
		freopen((name+".in").c_str(), "r", stdin); // see /general/io
		freopen((name+".out").c_str(), "w", stdout);
	}
}

int main() {
	setIO();

}
```

You don't have to use the template, but avoid using additional macros beyond the
ones listed above. In particular, for loop macros are highly discouraged.

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

<Info title="Java I/O">

`Scanner` is [significantly slower](/general/fast-io?lang=java#fast-input) than
`BufferedReader` and should be avoided.

To improve readability, Java solutions using `BufferedReader` should use a
wrapper class around input (preferably
[`Kattio`](/general/io?lang=java#io-template) for consistency, or use your own
variant if you really want).
